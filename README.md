Data used to create the Poor People's Pandemic Report

# A Poor People's Pandemic Report 2022  
##  Mapping the Intersection of Poverty, Race, and COVID-19
COVID-19 effects on poor communities in the US. 

## Report Description
This project aims to explore the disproportionate effects of COVID-19 on poor communities in the US by connecting data about COVID-19 deaths at the county level to other demographic characteristics. In doing so, it offers an initial analysis of the deadly community-level consequences of poverty, economic insecurity, and systemic racism. Poverty here is defined as people living below 200% of the official poverty measure, thereby including both “poor” and “low-income” populations. Although data gaps obscure a more detailed analysis of people directly, combined with other research, these results highlight the characteristics of some of the communities that were most impacted by the pandemic.
